# InfoQ Software Architecture and Design Trends Report - April 2024


https://www.infoq.com/articles/architecture-trends-2024/

The April 2024 InfoQ Software Architecture and Design Trends Report is interesting as it dives into several emerging technologies and approaches that are reshaping the software development framework. One of the key trends is the adoption of cell-based architectures, which help isolate services to improve performance and reduce latency. This technique has been successfully implemented by companies like Roblox and DoorDash to enhance system availability while cutting costs. This concept is analogous to a bulkhead in a ship, in which walls divide the ship's interior so that potential floods are isolated in one portion of the ship. Another interesting highlight from the report is the rise of privacy engineering, where companies are now proactively designing systems with privacy as a core principle, rather than merely responding to regulatory standards. This approach emphasizes user data protection from the initial design stages, marking a shift in how developers prioritize security in software architecture.
